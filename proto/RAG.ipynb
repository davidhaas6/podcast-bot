       "['Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \\n\\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \\n\\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \\n\\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \\n\\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \\n\\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \\n\\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \\n\\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \\n\\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world.',\n",
       " 'Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland. \\n\\nIn this struggle as President Zelenskyy said in his speech to the European Parliament “Light will win over darkness.” The Ukrainian Ambassador to the United States is here tonight. \\n\\nLet each of us here tonight in this Chamber send an unmistakable signal to Ukraine and to the world. \\n\\nPlease rise if you are able and show that, Yes, we the United States of America stand with the Ukrainian people. \\n\\nThroughout our history we’ve learned this lesson when dictators do not pay a price for their aggression they cause more chaos.   \\n\\nThey keep moving.   \\n\\nAnd the costs and the threats to America and the world keep rising.   \\n\\nThat’s why the NATO Alliance was created to secure peace and stability in Europe after World War 2. \\n\\nThe United States is a member along with 29 other nations. \\n\\nIt matters. American diplomacy matters. American resolve matters.',\n",
       " 'It matters. American diplomacy matters. American resolve matters. \\n\\nPutin’s latest attack on Ukraine was premeditated and unprovoked. \\n\\nHe rejected repeated efforts at diplomacy. \\n\\nHe thought the West and NATO wouldn’t respond. And he thought he could divide us at home. Putin was wrong. We were ready.  Here is what we did.   \\n\\nWe prepared extensively and carefully. \\n\\nWe spent months building a coalition of other freedom-loving nations from Europe and the Americas to Asia and Africa to confront Putin. \\n\\nI spent countless hours unifying our European allies. We shared with the world in advance what we knew Putin was planning and precisely how he would try to falsely justify his aggression.  \\n\\nWe countered Russia’s lies with truth.   \\n\\nAnd now that he has acted the free world is holding him accountable.',\n",
       " 'And now that he has acted the free world is holding him accountable. \\n\\nAlong with twenty-seven members of the European Union including France, Germany, Italy, as well as countries like the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Korea, Australia, New Zealand, and many others, even Switzerland. \\n\\nWe are inflicting pain on Russia and supporting the people of Ukraine. Putin is now isolated from the world more than ever. \\n\\nTogether with our allies –we are right now enforcing powerful economic sanctions. \\n\\nWe are cutting off Russia’s largest banks from the international financial system.  \\n\\nPreventing Russia’s central bank from defending the Russian Ruble making Putin’s $630 Billion “war fund” worthless.   \\n\\nWe are choking off Russia’s access to technology that will sap its economic strength and weaken its military for years to come.  \\n\\nTonight I say to the Russian oligarchs and corrupt leaders who have bilked billions of dollars off this violent regime no more.',\n",
       " 'The U.S. Department of Justice is assembling a dedicated task force to go after the crimes of Russian oligarchs.  \\n\\nWe are joining with our European allies to find and seize your yachts your luxury apartments your private jets. We are coming for your ill-begotten gains. \\n\\nAnd tonight I am announcing that we will join our allies in closing off American air space to all Russian flights – further isolating Russia – and adding an additional squeeze –on their economy. The Ruble has lost 30% of its value. \\n\\nThe Russian stock market has lost 40% of its value and trading remains suspended. Russia’s economy is reeling and Putin alone is to blame. \\n\\nTogether with our allies we are providing support to the Ukrainians in their fight for freedom. Military assistance. Economic assistance. Humanitarian assistance. \\n\\nWe are giving more than $1 Billion in direct assistance to Ukraine. \\n\\nAnd we will continue to aid the Ukrainian people as they defend their country and to help ease their suffering.',\n",
       " 'Let me be clear, our forces are not engaged and will not engage in conflict with Russian forces in Ukraine.  \\n\\nOur forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine, but to defend our NATO Allies – in the event that Putin decides to keep moving west.  \\n\\nFor that purpose we’ve mobilized American ground forces, air squadrons, and ship deployments to protect NATO countries including Poland, Romania, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. \\n\\nAs I have made crystal clear the United States and our Allies will defend every inch of territory of NATO countries with the full force of our collective power.  \\n\\nAnd we remain clear-eyed. The Ukrainians are fighting back with pure courage. But the next few days weeks, months, will be hard on them.  \\n\\nPutin has unleashed violence and chaos.  But while he may make gains on the battlefield – he will pay a continuing high price over the long run.',\n",
       " 'And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \\n\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\n\\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\n\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\n\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\n\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming.',\n",
       " 'But I want you to know that we are going to be okay. \\n\\nWhen the history of this era is written Putin’s war on Ukraine will have left Russia weaker and the rest of the world stronger. \\n\\nWhile it shouldn’t have taken something so terrible for people around the world to see what’s at stake now everyone sees it clearly. \\n\\nWe see the unity among leaders of nations and a more unified Europe a more unified West. And we see unity among the people who are gathering in cities in large crowds around the world even in Russia to demonstrate their support for Ukraine.  \\n\\nIn the battle between democracy and autocracy, democracies are rising to the moment, and the world is clearly choosing the side of peace and security. \\n\\nThis is a real test. It’s going to take time. So let us continue to draw inspiration from the iron will of the Ukrainian people. \\n\\nTo our fellow Ukrainian Americans who forge a deep bond that connects our two nations we stand with you.',\n",
       " 'Putin may circle Kyiv with tanks, but he will never gain the hearts and souls of the Ukrainian people. \\n\\nHe will never extinguish their love of freedom. He will never weaken the resolve of the free world. \\n\\nWe meet tonight in an America that has lived through two of the hardest years this nation has ever faced. \\n\\nThe pandemic has been punishing. \\n\\nAnd so many families are living paycheck to paycheck, struggling to keep up with the rising cost of food, gas, housing, and so much more. \\n\\nI understand. \\n\\nI remember when my Dad had to leave our home in Scranton, Pennsylvania to find work. I grew up in a family where if the price of food went up, you felt it. \\n\\nThat’s why one of the first things I did as President was fight to pass the American Rescue Plan.  \\n\\nBecause people were hurting. We needed to act, and we did. \\n\\nFew pieces of legislation have done more in a critical moment in our history to lift us out of crisis.',\n",
       " 'It fueled our efforts to vaccinate the nation and combat COVID-19. It delivered immediate economic relief for tens of millions of Americans.  \\n\\nHelped put food on their table, keep a roof over their heads, and cut the cost of health insurance. \\n\\nAnd as my Dad used to say, it gave people a little breathing room. \\n\\nAnd unlike the $2 Trillion tax cut passed in the previous administration that benefitted the top 1% of Americans, the American Rescue Plan helped working people—and left no one behind. \\n\\nAnd it worked. It created jobs. Lots of jobs. \\n\\nIn fact—our economy created over 6.5 Million new jobs just last year, more jobs created in one year  \\nthan ever before in the history of America. \\n\\nOur economy grew at a rate of 5.7% last year, the strongest growth in nearly 40 years, the first step in bringing fundamental change to an economy that hasn’t worked for the working people of this nation for too long.',\n",
       " 'For the past 40 years we were told that if we gave tax breaks to those at the very top, the benefits would trickle down to everyone else. \\n\\nBut that trickle-down theory led to weaker economic growth, lower wages, bigger deficits, and the widest gap between those at the top and everyone else in nearly a century. \\n\\nVice President Harris and I ran for office with a new economic vision for America. \\n\\nInvest in America. Educate Americans. Grow the workforce. Build the economy from the bottom up  \\nand the middle out, not from the top down.  \\n\\nBecause we know that when the middle class grows, the poor have a ladder up and the wealthy do very well. \\n\\nAmerica used to have the best roads, bridges, and airports on Earth. \\n\\nNow our infrastructure is ranked 13th in the world. \\n\\nWe won’t be able to compete for the jobs of the 21st Century if we don’t fix that. \\n\\nThat’s why it was so important to pass the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law—the most sweeping investment to rebuild America in history.',\n",
       " 'This was a bipartisan effort, and I want to thank the members of both parties who worked to make it happen. \\n\\nWe’re done talking about infrastructure weeks. \\n\\nWe’re going to have an infrastructure decade. \\n\\nIt is going to transform America and put us on a path to win the economic competition of the 21st Century that we face with the rest of the world—particularly with China.  \\n\\nAs I’ve told Xi Jinping, it is never a good bet to bet against the American people. \\n\\nWe’ll create good jobs for millions of Americans, modernizing roads, airports, ports, and waterways all across America. \\n\\nAnd we’ll do it all to withstand the devastating effects of the climate crisis and promote environmental justice.',\n",
       " 'We’ll build a national network of 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations, begin to replace poisonous lead pipes—so every child—and every American—has clean water to drink at home and at school, provide affordable high-speed internet for every American—urban, suburban, rural, and tribal communities. \\n\\n4,000 projects have already been announced. \\n\\nAnd tonight, I’m announcing that this year we will start fixing over 65,000 miles of highway and 1,500 bridges in disrepair. \\n\\nWhen we use taxpayer dollars to rebuild America – we are going to Buy American: buy American products to support American jobs. \\n\\nThe federal government spends about $600 Billion a year to keep the country safe and secure. \\n\\nThere’s been a law on the books for almost a century \\nto make sure taxpayers’ dollars support American jobs and businesses. \\n\\nEvery Administration says they’ll do it, but we are actually doing it.',\n",
       " 'Every Administration says they’ll do it, but we are actually doing it. \\n\\nWe will buy American to make sure everything from the deck of an aircraft carrier to the steel on highway guardrails are made in America. \\n\\nBut to compete for the best jobs of the future, we also need to level the playing field with China and other competitors. \\n\\nThat’s why it is so important to pass the Bipartisan Innovation Act sitting in Congress that will make record investments in emerging technologies and American manufacturing. \\n\\nLet me give you one example of why it’s so important to pass it. \\n\\nIf you travel 20 miles east of Columbus, Ohio, you’ll find 1,000 empty acres of land. \\n\\nIt won’t look like much, but if you stop and look closely, you’ll see a “Field of dreams,” the ground on which America’s future will be built. \\n\\nThis is where Intel, the American company that helped build Silicon Valley, is going to build its $20 billion semiconductor “mega site”.',\n",
       " 'Up to eight state-of-the-art factories in one place. 10,000 new good-paying jobs. \\n\\nSome of the most sophisticated manufacturing in the world to make computer chips the size of a fingertip that power the world and our everyday lives. \\n\\nSmartphones. The Internet. Technology we have yet to invent. \\n\\nBut that’s just the beginning. \\n\\nIntel’s CEO, Pat Gelsinger, who is here tonight, told me they are ready to increase their investment from  \\n$20 billion to $100 billion. \\n\\nThat would be one of the biggest investments in manufacturing in American history. \\n\\nAnd all they’re waiting for is for you to pass this bill. \\n\\nSo let’s not wait any longer. Send it to my desk. I’ll sign it.  \\n\\nAnd we will really take off. \\n\\nAnd Intel is not alone. \\n\\nThere’s something happening in America. \\n\\nJust look around and you’ll see an amazing story. \\n\\nThe rebirth of the pride that comes from stamping products “Made In America.” The revitalization of American manufacturing.',\n",
       " 'Companies are choosing to build new factories here, when just a few years ago, they would have built them overseas. \\n\\nThat’s what is happening. Ford is investing $11 billion to build electric vehicles, creating 11,000 jobs across the country. \\n\\nGM is making the largest investment in its history—$7 billion to build electric vehicles, creating 4,000 jobs in Michigan. \\n\\nAll told, we created 369,000 new manufacturing jobs in America just last year. \\n\\nPowered by people I’ve met like JoJo Burgess, from generations of union steelworkers from Pittsburgh, who’s here with us tonight. \\n\\nAs Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown says, “It’s time to bury the label “Rust Belt.” \\n\\nIt’s time. \\n\\nBut with all the bright spots in our economy, record job growth and higher wages, too many families are struggling to keep up with the bills.  \\n\\nInflation is robbing them of the gains they might otherwise feel. \\n\\nI get it. That’s why my top priority is getting prices under control.',\n",
       " 'I get it. That’s why my top priority is getting prices under control. \\n\\nLook, our economy roared back faster than most predicted, but the pandemic meant that businesses had a hard time hiring enough workers to keep up production in their factories. \\n\\nThe pandemic also disrupted global supply chains. \\n\\nWhen factories close, it takes longer to make goods and get them from the warehouse to the store, and prices go up. \\n\\nLook at cars. \\n\\nLast year, there weren’t enough semiconductors to make all the cars that people wanted to buy. \\n\\nAnd guess what, prices of automobiles went up. \\n\\nSo—we have a choice. \\n\\nOne way to fight inflation is to drive down wages and make Americans poorer.  \\n\\nI have a better plan to fight inflation. \\n\\nLower your costs, not your wages. \\n\\nMake more cars and semiconductors in America. \\n\\nMore infrastructure and innovation in America. \\n\\nMore goods moving faster and cheaper in America. \\n\\nMore jobs where you can earn a good living in America.',\n",
       " 'More jobs where you can earn a good living in America. \\n\\nAnd instead of relying on foreign supply chains, let’s make it in America. \\n\\nEconomists call it “increasing the productive capacity of our economy.” \\n\\nI call it building a better America. \\n\\nMy plan to fight inflation will lower your costs and lower the deficit. \\n\\n17 Nobel laureates in economics say my plan will ease long-term inflationary pressures. Top business leaders and most Americans support my plan. And here’s the plan: \\n\\nFirst – cut the cost of prescription drugs. Just look at insulin. One in ten Americans has diabetes. In Virginia, I met a 13-year-old boy named Joshua Davis.  \\n\\nHe and his Dad both have Type 1 diabetes, which means they need insulin every day. Insulin costs about $10 a vial to make.  \\n\\nBut drug companies charge families like Joshua and his Dad up to 30 times more. I spoke with Joshua’s mom. \\n\\nImagine what it’s like to look at your child who needs insulin and have no idea how you’re going to pay for it.',\n",
       " 'What it does to your dignity, your ability to look your child in the eye, to be the parent you expect to be. \\n\\nJoshua is here with us tonight. Yesterday was his birthday. Happy birthday, buddy.  \\n\\nFor Joshua, and for the 200,000 other young people with Type 1 diabetes, let’s cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month so everyone can afford it.  \\n\\nDrug companies will still do very well. And while we’re at it let Medicare negotiate lower prices for prescription drugs, like the VA already does. \\n\\nLook, the American Rescue Plan is helping millions of families on Affordable Care Act plans save $2,400 a year on their health care premiums. Let’s close the coverage gap and make those savings permanent. \\n\\nSecond – cut energy costs for families an average of $500 a year by combatting climate change.',\n",
       " 'Second – cut energy costs for families an average of $500 a year by combatting climate change.  \\n\\nLet’s provide investments and tax credits to weatherize your homes and businesses to be energy efficient and you get a tax credit; double America’s clean energy production in solar, wind, and so much more;  lower the price of electric vehicles, saving you another $80 a month because you’ll never have to pay at the gas pump again. \\n\\nThird – cut the cost of child care. Many families pay up to $14,000 a year for child care per child.  \\n\\nMiddle-class and working families shouldn’t have to pay more than 7% of their income for care of young children.  \\n\\nMy plan will cut the cost in half for most families and help parents, including millions of women, who left the workforce during the pandemic because they couldn’t afford child care, to be able to get back to work.',\n",
       " 'My plan doesn’t stop there. It also includes home and long-term care. More affordable housing. And Pre-K for every 3- and 4-year-old.  \\n\\nAll of these will lower costs. \\n\\nAnd under my plan, nobody earning less than $400,000 a year will pay an additional penny in new taxes. Nobody.  \\n\\nThe one thing all Americans agree on is that the tax system is not fair. We have to fix it.  \\n\\nI’m not looking to punish anyone. But let’s make sure corporations and the wealthiest Americans start paying their fair share. \\n\\nJust last year, 55 Fortune 500 corporations earned $40 billion in profits and paid zero dollars in federal income tax.  \\n\\nThat’s simply not fair. That’s why I’ve proposed a 15% minimum tax rate for corporations. \\n\\nWe got more than 130 countries to agree on a global minimum tax rate so companies can’t get out of paying their taxes at home by shipping jobs and factories overseas.',\n",
       " 'That’s why I’ve proposed closing loopholes so the very wealthy don’t pay a lower tax rate than a teacher or a firefighter.  \\n\\nSo that’s my plan. It will grow the economy and lower costs for families. \\n\\nSo what are we waiting for? Let’s get this done. And while you’re at it, confirm my nominees to the Federal Reserve, which plays a critical role in fighting inflation.  \\n\\nMy plan will not only lower costs to give families a fair shot, it will lower the deficit. \\n\\nThe previous Administration not only ballooned the deficit with tax cuts for the very wealthy and corporations, it undermined the watchdogs whose job was to keep pandemic relief funds from being wasted. \\n\\nBut in my administration, the watchdogs have been welcomed back. \\n\\nWe’re going after the criminals who stole billions in relief money meant for small businesses and millions of Americans.  \\n\\nAnd tonight, I’m announcing that the Justice Department will name a chief prosecutor for pandemic fraud.',\n",
       " 'By the end of this year, the deficit will be down to less than half what it was before I took office.  \\n\\nThe only president ever to cut the deficit by more than one trillion dollars in a single year. \\n\\nLowering your costs also means demanding more competition. \\n\\nI’m a capitalist, but capitalism without competition isn’t capitalism. \\n\\nIt’s exploitation—and it drives up prices. \\n\\nWhen corporations don’t have to compete, their profits go up, your prices go up, and small businesses and family farmers and ranchers go under. \\n\\nWe see it happening with ocean carriers moving goods in and out of America. \\n\\nDuring the pandemic, these foreign-owned companies raised prices by as much as 1,000% and made record profits. \\n\\nTonight, I’m announcing a crackdown on these companies overcharging American businesses and consumers. \\n\\nAnd as Wall Street firms take over more nursing homes, quality in those homes has gone down and costs have gone up.  \\n\\nThat ends on my watch.',\n",
       " 'That ends on my watch. \\n\\nMedicare is going to set higher standards for nursing homes and make sure your loved ones get the care they deserve and expect. \\n\\nWe’ll also cut costs and keep the economy going strong by giving workers a fair shot, provide more training and apprenticeships, hire them based on their skills not degrees. \\n\\nLet’s pass the Paycheck Fairness Act and paid leave.  \\n\\nRaise the minimum wage to $15 an hour and extend the Child Tax Credit, so no one has to raise a family in poverty. \\n\\nLet’s increase Pell Grants and increase our historic support of HBCUs, and invest in what Jill—our First Lady who teaches full-time—calls America’s best-kept secret: community colleges. \\n\\nAnd let’s pass the PRO Act when a majority of workers want to form a union—they shouldn’t be stopped.  \\n\\nWhen we invest in our workers, when we build the economy from the bottom up and the middle out together, we can do something we haven’t done in a long time: build a better America.',\n",
       " 'For more than two years, COVID-19 has impacted every decision in our lives and the life of the nation. \\n\\nAnd I know you’re tired, frustrated, and exhausted. \\n\\nBut I also know this. \\n\\nBecause of the progress we’ve made, because of your resilience and the tools we have, tonight I can say  \\nwe are moving forward safely, back to more normal routines.  \\n\\nWe’ve reached a new moment in the fight against COVID-19, with severe cases down to a level not seen since last July.  \\n\\nJust a few days ago, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention—the CDC—issued new mask guidelines. \\n\\nUnder these new guidelines, most Americans in most of the country can now be mask free.   \\n\\nAnd based on the projections, more of the country will reach that point across the next couple of weeks. \\n\\nThanks to the progress we have made this past year, COVID-19 need no longer control our lives.  \\n\\nI know some are talking about “living with COVID-19”. Tonight – I say that we will never just accept living with COVID-19.',\n",
       " 'We will continue to combat the virus as we do other diseases. And because this is a virus that mutates and spreads, we will stay on guard. \\n\\nHere are four common sense steps as we move forward safely.  \\n\\nFirst, stay protected with vaccines and treatments. We know how incredibly effective vaccines are. If you’re vaccinated and boosted you have the highest degree of protection. \\n\\nWe will never give up on vaccinating more Americans. Now, I know parents with kids under 5 are eager to see a vaccine authorized for their children. \\n\\nThe scientists are working hard to get that done and we’ll be ready with plenty of vaccines when they do. \\n\\nWe’re also ready with anti-viral treatments. If you get COVID-19, the Pfizer pill reduces your chances of ending up in the hospital by 90%.  \\n\\nWe’ve ordered more of these pills than anyone in the world. And Pfizer is working overtime to get us 1 Million pills this month and more than double that next month.',\n",
       " 'And we’re launching the “Test to Treat” initiative so people can get tested at a pharmacy, and if they’re positive, receive antiviral pills on the spot at no cost.  \\n\\nIf you’re immunocompromised or have some other vulnerability, we have treatments and free high-quality masks. \\n\\nWe’re leaving no one behind or ignoring anyone’s needs as we move forward. \\n\\nAnd on testing, we have made hundreds of millions of tests available for you to order for free.   \\n\\nEven if you already ordered free tests tonight, I am announcing that you can order more from covidtests.gov starting next week. \\n\\nSecond – we must prepare for new variants. Over the past year, we’ve gotten much better at detecting new variants. \\n\\nIf necessary, we’ll be able to deploy new vaccines within 100 days instead of many more months or years.  \\n\\nAnd, if Congress provides the funds we need, we’ll have new stockpiles of tests, masks, and pills ready if needed.',\n",
       " 'I cannot promise a new variant won’t come. But I can promise you we’ll do everything within our power to be ready if it does.  \\n\\nThird – we can end the shutdown of schools and businesses. We have the tools we need. \\n\\nIt’s time for Americans to get back to work and fill our great downtowns again.  People working from home can feel safe to begin to return to the office.   \\n\\nWe’re doing that here in the federal government. The vast majority of federal workers will once again work in person. \\n\\nOur schools are open. Let’s keep it that way. Our kids need to be in school. \\n\\nAnd with 75% of adult Americans fully vaccinated and hospitalizations down by 77%, most Americans can remove their masks, return to work, stay in the classroom, and move forward safely. \\n\\nWe achieved this because we provided free vaccines, treatments, tests, and masks. \\n\\nOf course, continuing this costs money. \\n\\nI will soon send Congress a request.',\n",
       " 'Of course, continuing this costs money. \\n\\nI will soon send Congress a request. \\n\\nThe vast majority of Americans have used these tools and may want to again, so I expect Congress to pass it quickly.   \\n\\nFourth, we will continue vaccinating the world.     \\n\\nWe’ve sent 475 Million vaccine doses to 112 countries, more than any other nation. \\n\\nAnd we won’t stop. \\n\\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \\n\\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \\n\\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \\n\\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\n\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera.',\n",
       " 'They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\n\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\n\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\n\\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\n\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves. \\n\\nI’ve worked on these issues a long time. \\n\\nI know what works: Investing in crime prevention and community police officers who’ll walk the beat, who’ll know the neighborhood, and who can restore trust and safety. \\n\\nSo let’s not abandon our streets. Or choose between safety and equal justice. \\n\\nLet’s come together to protect our communities, restore trust, and hold law enforcement accountable. \\n\\nThat’s why the Justice Department required body cameras, banned chokeholds, and restricted no-knock warrants for its officers.',\n",
       " 'That’s why the American Rescue Plan provided $350 Billion that cities, states, and counties can use to hire more police and invest in proven strategies like community violence interruption—trusted messengers breaking the cycle of violence and trauma and giving young people hope.  \\n\\nWe should all agree: The answer is not to Defund the police. The answer is to FUND the police with the resources and training they need to protect our communities. \\n\\nI ask Democrats and Republicans alike: Pass my budget and keep our neighborhoods safe.  \\n\\nAnd I will keep doing everything in my power to crack down on gun trafficking and ghost guns you can buy online and make at home—they have no serial numbers and can’t be traced. \\n\\nAnd I ask Congress to pass proven measures to reduce gun violence.

And it’s under assault. \\n\\nIn state after state, new laws have been passed, not only to suppress the vote, but to subvert entire elections. \\n\\nWe cannot let this happen. \\n\\nTonight. I call on the Senate to: Pass the Freedom to Vote Act. Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. And while you’re at it, pass the Disclose Act so Americans can know who is funding our elections. \\n\\nTonight, I’d like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyer—an Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, thank you for your service.',\n",

And from a family of public school educators and police officers. A consensus builder. Since she’s been nominated, she’s received a broad range of support—from the Fraternal Order of Police to former judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans. \\n\\nAnd if we are to advance liberty and justice, we need to secure the Border and fix the immigration system. \\n\\nWe can do both.

Four big things we can do together.  \\n\\nFirst, beat the opioid epidemic. \\n\\nThere is so much we can do. Increase funding for prevention, treatment, harm reduction, and recovery.  \\n\\nGet rid of outdated rules that stop doctors from prescribing treatments. And stop the flow of illicit drugs by working with state and local law enforcement to go after traffickers. \\n\\nIf you’re suffering from addiction, know you are not alone. I believe in recovery, and I celebrate the 23 million Americans in recovery.',\n",
       " 'Second, let’s take on mental health. Especially among our children, whose lives and education have been turned upside down.  \\n\\nThe American Rescue Plan gave schools money to hire teachers and help students make up for lost learning.  \\n\\nI urge every parent to make sure your school does just that. And we can all play a part—sign up to be a tutor or a mentor. \\n\\nChildren were also struggling before the pandemic. Bullying, violence, trauma, and the harms of social media. \\n\\nAs Frances Haugen, who is here with us tonight, has shown, we must hold social media platforms accountable for the national experiment they’re conducting on our children for profit. \\n\\nIt’s time to strengthen privacy protections, ban targeted advertising to children, demand tech companies stop collecting personal data on our children. \\n\\nAnd let’s get all Americans the mental health services they need. More people they can turn to for help, and full parity between physical and mental health care.',\n",
       " 'Third, support our veterans. \\n\\nVeterans are the best of us. \\n\\nI’ve always believed that we have a sacred obligation to equip all those we send to war and care for them and their families when they come home. \\n\\nMy administration is providing assistance with job training and housing, and now helping lower-income veterans get VA care debt-free.  \\n\\nOur troops in Iraq and Afghanistan faced many dangers. \\n\\nOne was stationed at bases and breathing in toxic smoke from “burn pits” that incinerated wastes of war—medical and hazard material, jet fuel, and more. \\n\\nWhen they came home, many of the world’s fittest and best trained warriors were never the same. \\n\\nHeadaches. Numbness. Dizziness. \\n\\nA cancer that would put them in a flag-draped coffin. \\n\\nI know. \\n\\nOne of those soldiers was my son Major Beau Biden. \\n\\nWe don’t know for sure if a burn pit was the cause of his brain cancer, or the diseases of so many of our troops. \\n\\nBut I’m committed to finding out everything we can.',\n",

       "'first thing maybe to say here is that this is OBVIOUSLY an incredibly dumb way of talking about nature. I mean, Nature walk? Like what you’re going on a pilgrimage to nature now? Hold on, so a bird builds a nest.. and THAT’S nature...but people make buildings and cities and that’s not nature? No, you ARE nature! When you DRIVE to the trail to go on a nature walk there’s no sign that says “Now Entering Nature”. This is an IMPORTANT POINT...because the VALUE... people are getting from what they might call a Nature walk...Kierkegaard would say might have more to do with moving AWAY from this realm up in our heads of human concerns that they’re otherwise serving a life sentence in.\\xa0THAT’S the REAL benefit of a nature walk. When they move AWAY from this realm of constant desires and projects...they start to feel CONNECTED to something ELSE...and they’ll describe this something else in a number of ways depending on the language they use: they may say they feel connected to something greater than themselves, to the universe, to nature, to God, to the GROUND of our being...whatever guarantees the continuity of existence from moment to moment, many different ways to think of it...but regardless of the terminology the individual person is appropriating to describe their experience here...this is a UNIVERSAL human experience...and the question we have to ask is: what is that thing... that they are connecting with that lies OUTSIDE the realm of human concern?\\xa0Talk about it in any way you want...but Kierkegaard is going to call this getting closer to God’s Kingdom. Now ON this hypothetical nature walk, although to Kierkegaard this can be found ANYWHERE...on this nature walk we move away from the temporal realm of human concern into something that more resembles a, sort of, eternal present. When we take a second to stop thinking about our projects in life and return to this type of immediacy...think of the lily that you might COME across on one of these walks.\\xa0Consider the fact that the lily of the field is never trying to be something that it’s not. It just sort of, IS... within its own environment. It doesn’t DESIRE TO BE anything OTHER than what it is, it doesn’t COMPARE itself to other lillies, it doesn’t make plans to blossom in the summertime.\\xa0The bird of the air... doesn’t have a 5 year plan and a vision board that it looks at every day. It doesn’t COMPARE its life to the life of a domesticated bird...The lily and the bird don’t sit around and ruminate on what might or might not happen to them, and BECAUSE OF THIS...they are removed from the noisy chaos OF that realm of human concern.\\xa0Noise. Good way to describe the realm of human concern sometimes. Chatter, meaningless talking, all different ways people describe it. What does the lily have on the nature walk that we DON’T have serving a life sentence in the realm of human concerns and projects? Well, what is the antidote to noise? Silence.\\xa0Kierkegaard’s work The Lily of the Field and Bird of the Air is divided into three separate discourses...each discourse corresponding to one of the three stages of life he thought people may pass through...each of these respectively exploring a different skill we can learn from the lily and the bird. The skill exemplified in the FIRST discourse of the book...one thing we can LEARN about OURSELVES from the existence of the lily and the bird...is the value of silence.\\xa0Now should be said: at the core of all THREE of these discourses is the implication... that because of how we were created as human beings...we tend to gravitate towards certain behaviors. Certain behaviors that sometimes cause us problems when it comes to carrying out the value systems we’ve been creating on this series so far.\\xa0Each discourse offers a skill we should practice if we want to avoid common pitfalls that prevent us from carrying out our system of values. Once again, the FIRST one is the value of silence.\\xa0Because by default it seems...human beings seem to gravitate towards noise...sitting up in this abstract place up in our heads and comparing things and worrying about things and regretting things. We ruminate on things we want to happen, we ruminate on things we DON’T want to have happen. We make plans for how to make those things happen or not. We doubt our plans. We doubt our values, we doubt ourselves.\\xa0But to Kierkegaard...all this desiring, striving, comparing, strategizing….credit where credit’s due...all of these things DEFINITELY are a part of our lives and they definitely give us REAL advantages as people. But he’d say that...sometimes... when it comes to CARRYING OUT your system of values that you’ve committed yourself to...SOMETIMES the BEST skill you can have... has nothing to do with THINKING...in fact it’s the opposite. Sometimes the best skill you can have is the ability to TURN OFF your brain, turn OFF this realm of human concern... and be SILENT for a while.\\xa0Now...people will no doubt draw comparisons to being in the present, mindfulness meditation, taming the monkey mind...and that would be a very contemplative, modern, scientific way of talking about these universal human experiences, and if that’s the language YOU want to use in this discussion that’s totally fine...but understand that to RELEGATE, what Kierkegaard is saying here TO THAT DESCRIPTION alone...would be missing out on some cool stuff that he’s adding on.\\xa0Let me start here...you probably gravitate towards a podcast like this one because you consider yourself to be a thinking person. People around you... PROBABLY tell you that you overthink things...or think too much. You probably spend TOO MUCH TIME up in this realm of representation and human concern that Kierkegaard’s talking about.\\xa0By the way you spend so much TIME in that place...because you’re GOOD at it. Comparing things, recognizing patterns...THIS is what has helped you survive so far AS a smart person! No WONDER you’d gravitate towards that realm. The PROBLEM Kierkegaard would say is that once you’ve neatly crafted a set of values and a set of projects to instate them...you stay up in your head and end up sabotaging your own efforts, lost in the infinite. Lost in the NOISE...of talking yourself OUT of whatever your values are.\\xa0Let’s talk more for a minute about this noise in the realm of human concern. In the first discourse Kierkegaard takes issue with the archetype of the poet. The quintessential poet to Kierkegaard uses BEAUTIFUL prose to relay to people the BEAUTY of God’s Kingdom. Like rainfall my spirit laid the animals to slumber. And forthwith across the riverbank in the eye of the sparrow I witnessed the infinite. On one hand: beautiful words, I mean so talented clearly. On the other hand though...Who...What are we even talking about there? Who REALLY thinks in those words? Who relates to someone talking like that. This BOTHERED Kierkegaard. Not because he doesn’t like poetry...just the fact that it is CLEARLY someone disingenuously trying to convey a relationship with God’s kingdom through a bunch of fancy words that might end up doing more harm than good.\\xa0See JUST like Nietzsche Kierkegaard was frustrated with the church of his time. By his account there were a LOT OF PEOPLE out there that would OTHERWISE BE practicing Christians...but they felt completely alienated by the whole process. And poets...while their INTENTIONS are good...only seem to make things worse when describing God’s kingdom. For every person they inspire how many do they leave feeling alone and intimidated because they just DON’T see God’s kingdom in these glowing poetic terms?To put it in modern secular language...and there’s a million examples we could USE here...but think about motivational personalities on the internet. Similar to the poet...their intentions are good...they want to inspire people to live their set of values. Their days are simple. They wake up, they do their obligatory post on instagram with the sun rising... and they talk about their day HERALDING THE GLORY of the KINGDOM they live in...GRATEFUL...for yet another day to GRIND towards their goals it was a privilege...to get stuck in traffic today...it was a PRIVILEGE to black out at the gym today...the worry of the paramedics was just WEAKNESS leaving their bodies, we all know these people…To their credit...these people are DEFINITELY desiring, striving and instating their set of values in the world in a Nietzschean sense...but for every one person they INSPIRE, to live in keeping with their values...how many people look at one of these inspirational people and feel inspired for, about three days, and then feel like maybe they just aren’t cut out for this kind of life...because when it comes to their OWN internal experience...they don’t seem to feel ANYTHING LIKE this POET of inspiration.\\xa0Kierkegaard might also say here: how many times do you REALLY need to hear work hard? How many times does someone have to tell you to be process oriented? Or reach for the stars...HOW LONG...before this ENTIRE PROCESS...starts to just sound like noise. The poet of the first discourse represents someone with a FALSE connection to God or nature, masked by a bunch of beautiful words, when it is in fact endless chatter and noise.SILENCE is the ANSWER to this noise. That’s how you get a TRUE connection to what grounds our being. Not talking...but listening. Kierkegaard thought once we reach a certain point we all generally know what we’re supposed to be doing in life. Meaning that if you’re a bad person...it’s NOT because you haven’t come across the right book of ethics or something...it’s not an awareness campaign...like, OH I’m supposed to plan for my future...I never THOUGHT about that before. No, CLEARLY that’s not the problem here, and CLEARLY you KNOW what you should be doing. And when it comes to actually carrying out your system of values EVERY DAY, and motivational speakers and poets and all the like...the problem is NOT to Kierkegaard...that you haven’t found the RIGHT'"

      "\"So in one of her earlier essays… Susan Sontag talks about a life changing moment she experienced when she was just 12 years old. Now, she described this moment when she wrote about it…as a kind of revelation…in fact, she called it a type of EPIPHANY, that would go on to affect the direction of her thinking AND her work, for DECADES moving into the future. It was July of 1945…she was browsing through a random bookstore in Santa Monica, California…and what she came across was something she would later call “a photographic inventory of ultimate horror.” What she came across for the first time were pictures of the horrible things that were done to people in two of the concentration camps during the holocaust of the second world war. And, you can just imagine her standing there 12 years old, in the middle of this bookstore, looking at these pictures of mangled human bodies…taking in as a young person for the first time the DARKNESS that people are capable of when their minds dip into that place…that passive state of compliance…what Hannah Arendt called the banality of evil…this is the FIRST time in her life that she encounters this and Sontag later writes about how she FELT in that moment:“Nothing I have seen—in photographs or in real life—ever cut me as sharply, deeply, instantaneously. Indeed, it seems plausible to me to divide my life into two parts, before I saw those photographs…and after, though it was several years before I understood fully what they were about......Some limit had been reached, and not only that of horror; I felt irrevocably grieved, wounded, but a part of my feelings started to tighten; something went dead; something is still crying.\"Sontag didn’t know it at the time…but this TYPE of experience that she had in the bookstore… she would LATER think of it as a CLASSIC experience that EVERY person LIVING in the modern world EVENTUALLY has to have. We ALL eventually have to come face to face with IMAGES of HORRIBLE things that are going on in some distant part of the world… and THEN we gotta figure out what the best way is to DEAL with whatever feelings may come up as a RESULT of SEEING those images– this is a uniquely MODERN EXPERIENCE to Susan Sontag.  In fact the IMAGE ITSELF…is a uniquely MODERN thing that we all have to deal with. To put it as simply as possible: we have a COMPLICATED relationship with images as modern  people, and its borne out of a complicated past and if we’re being honest…looking into the future with AI created images…things aren’t lookin’ like they’re getting any easier any time soon. So maybe it’s time on this podcast we go on a little journey…and do a philosophical evaluation OF the IMAGE, more specifically, of pictures and videos, as things that are by THIS point…deeply normalized PIECES of TECHNOLOGY that we use EVERY DAY, as we go about our life. And I can think of nobody better to GUIDE us along this journey than Susan Sontag…see, she was a HUGE fan of the work of Roland Barthes who we did two episodes of this podcast on a few years ago. And if you remember from those episodes: one of the things he was MOST interested in ANALYZING in his work was what he thought of as a sort of MODERN MYTHOLOGY that we have today, or the accepted METAPHORS that we attach to SEEMINGLY everyday things that HELP us give them meaning… metaphors that HELP our societies function. And he did this with EVERYTHING…he looks at the mythology surrounding soap…how we always seem to be waging a war against uncleanliness in our lives, how great SOAP is for that whole process. He talks about the mythology of pro wrestling and how the messages sent by these people pretending to fight each other, a dude earing a thong throwing the atomic elbow may actually help to MAINTAIN societal order at some level. Point was: To BARTHES…it was important to look CRITICALLY AT these metaphors that we often take for granted…because in ways that aren’t always entirely obvious to us…these metaphors actually have a HUGE IMPACT on the way that people SEE the things that make up the culture they’re a part of.  Sontag takes inspiration from this line of thinking and then MAKES it her own. All throughout her career she does something very similar…she TAKES things that to US as modern people are SO NORMALIZED that we may never even really THINK about them…and then she REEXAMINES them, she REINTERPRETS them from a DIFFERENT perspective… and then brutally illustrates the social COST of having a lazy relationship with the mythology of everyday things. What I’m saying is that by the end of the episode here today we will understand EXACTLY what Susan Sontag thinks about someone who just PASSIVELY CONSUMES pictures and videos all day, putting in VERY little effort, not even RECOGNIZING how COMPLICATED their relationship to the IMAGE really is. So to get us started on that…Susan Sontag might want to START by saying…that pictures and videos are OBVIOUSLY the PRIMARY method of communication IN our modern world… but how many of us REALLY speak the LANGUAGE of pictures and videos? And she’s not asking… can you look at pictures and understand what they’re about…I mean, obviously…people are SATURATED by them, what Sontag’s talking about is: how many of us have REALLY taken the time to break down what these kinds of images ARE and ALL the functions they serve in culture? Might be helpful to try thinking about what we call an IMAGE…like you come from an alien civilization, that’s never used IMAGES to send information to each other before…maybe this civilization evolved with really big ears or something. How do you think an alien species would see pictures and videos? Well aside from noticing that this is how A LOT of people get their ENTIRE understanding of what’s going on outside their immediate surroundings…the OTHER thing an alien might notice is that WHAT a picture or video IS at the most fundamental level is something that’s DESIGNED to be a SIMPLIFICATION… of more complex modes of human experience. Now what would the alien with the big ears be TALKING about when they SAY that?Well, take a photograph for example. The THINKING here applies even at just a MATHEMATICAL level…just from a raw mathematical perspective…whenever you’re going from an N dimensional representation of something to a LOWER dimensional representation of something… you are LOSING a lot of information about it. So in the CASE of a photograph, when you go from a human experience that’s OTHERWISE in three dimensions, across a landscape of FIVE senses, various mental faculties that you’re filtering it through… and you REDUCE that experience into a two dimensional photograph… to a purely visual, single sensory form…again we HAVE to start by acknowledging that you are SIMPLIFYING that moment…and LOSING a TON of information about it in the process. What an alien might SAY about the concept of a picture is that it’s a pretty interesting thing…it is FUNDAMENTALLY something that takes complex situations and SIMPLIFIES them into something that can be CONSUMED visually in an instant. And on ONE level we ALL KNOW this. I mean, a picture’s worth a thousand words people say right? That’s what they DO. But ANOTHER thing an alien might want to point out…is that: GIVEN the fact that a picture or a video HAS to simplify reality…and GIVEN our tendency to USE these images as the primary way that we connect with things that are happening in the world…isn’t it a bit PROBLEMATIC, that the IMAGE is ALSO something that is SO EASILY manipulated, by people? Now before Susan Sontag launches into her FULL BLOWN critique of the image and its ROLE in society…the first thing she might want to start by saying is that she’s ALWAYS looking at the image from a perspective of ambiguity. She FULLY acknowledges that images can be used for GOOD AS WELL as EVIL. Which is also to say that DEPENDING on who’s GIVING you the images that you’re looking at…images can be used to INFORM the population…as well as to DECEIVE the population. And some of this is BEYOND OBVIOUS to us living in 2023, which I think speaks to how dead on accurate Susan Sontag WAS about this in her analysis. I don’t think I gotta tell ANYONE listening to this about how many cool things you’ve been able to see because of pictures and videos, that in most other generations of being alive…you’d just never have the opportunity to see… I mean the super bowl for us used to be chasing a raccoon around with a stick in your back yard. And this obviously extends from COOL things that you see… to things that are less fun…you see pictures of distant political realities, natural disasters, war, famine…Susan Sontag would want to say that the connection to events that pictures and videos can provide, on ONE level, is TRULY inspirational. I mean imagine the kind of AWARENESS a person could have about what’s going on in the world that they live in… if they were able to get access to images ABOUT what’s going on in a way that they could TRUST.But that TRUST thing. Ya see…that’s where it starts to get complicated to Susan Sontag. Cause something ELSE we all know in 2023, is that pictures and videos are NEVER presented to you in a totally UNBIASED way…images are ALWAYS given to you in a way that tries to drum up a particular emotional RESPONSE to them. And Sontag would say this is PART of the RELATIONSHIP you HAVE with pictures and videos that you can NEVER take for granted. Now in certain cases this can seem pretty harmless and it’s not something we doubt or really put too much thought into. Think of an online dating profile. We ALL KNOW the person sending you their picture WANTS you to think of them IN a particular way. They got the LIGHTING just right. They take a picture from a very SPECIFIC angle. Maybe they’re one of those people that have the exact same creepy smile in every picture looks like they photoshopped their smiling head in to different locations. Now I’m smiling in the mountains. Now I’m smiling while holding a puppy! It’s all very\"\n",

      "\"sees the SUFFERING of other people. They equate SEEING the images of people suffering… with KNOWING the suffering of other people. SEEING PICTURES or VIDEOS of what is going on allows them to feel a FALSE SENSE of familiarity with what other people are going through. Then they think as LONG as they CONTINUE to SEE IMAGES of the suffering that’s going on, EDUCATING themselves they call it…and as long as they post #neverforget, being an ACTIVIST they call it…as long as they COMMEMORATE what went on with these other people that suffered and SHARE the images with other people…as a deluded cult member, they actually feel through doing this stuff as though they’ve legitimized the suffering of others… by making a sarcastic post on social media they actually are able to believe they’ve done something substantive there. Sontag would say again, we have fallen into a place as a society where we focus far too much on commemoration, and not enough on contemplation…in other words: we focus on remembering things instead of DOING things, and PASSIVELY, UNCRITICALLY CONSUMING these pictures and videos people give us ENABLES us to do this…and we CARRY this emotionally disconnected, complicit attitude around with us in a LOT of different things…but one maybe UNEXPECTED place you can see it she says is in the mythology that surrounds our modern concept of a museum. Not sure if this is COMMON knowledge that everybody knows about…but fun fact the ORIGINS of the modern museum actually come from HUNDREDS of years ago and rich people that were living in Europe that had these things called curiosity cabinets. The idea is: if you’re a rich person living during the age of exploration…and there are these people traveling all over the world bringing back these artifacts that are mysterious…and these merchants that are trying to make some money off this stuff tell you oh this is a magic lamp from india! Oh this is a DRAGON bone we found in the caribbean…if you’re a rich person and you wanted to have something interesting to show guests when they come over to your house for dinner…you just bought this stuff. You say oh a dragon bone you say…hmm I guess I’ll put that in my CURIOSITY cabinet. And it wasn’t just DRAGON bones it was a lot of REAL stuff too: point is…this was a cabinet with a SMALL selection of old stuff, bankrolled by the social elite, FUELED by just intellectual curiosity…and then they USUALLY have a fun narrative that goes ALONG with the artifacts that tells an interesting story about how the world is out there on the seven seas or how the HISTORY of the world came to be to where we are now.Well to Susan Sontag, the experience of the modern person in a museum today is NOT entirely unlike this. You show up. You pay $20. And you walk around the halls VERY QUIETLY LOOKING at all this stuff that someone ELSE has the resources to collect. You’re given a particular narrative about the history of the world and how all this stuff fits IN to that narrative. And then you LEAVE the museum feeling just a little more CULTURED than you were when you walked in the ENTRANCE. That’s the MYTHOLOGY connected to GOING to a museum. IN other words a bunch of culturally privileged people, that’s US…PAY money to go satisfy their intellectual amusement…and then they’re GIVEN an oversimplified narrative of how these things in the museum FIT IN to past events…and then you can LEAVE the museum and pat yourself on the back for understanding things more. You leave the museum…and the feeling that washes over you is…hmm, well WASN’T THAT interesting. But there’s not a SINGLE reason in the world Sontag thinks that if the mythology SURROUNDING the museum was different…the average person that leaves the museum might INSTEAD feel FIRED UP about a new perspective they have of things…about taking ACTION in the world they live in. Imagine a museum that was centered around NOT JUST an inert commemoration of THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED in the past…but INSTEAD a museum that focuses on taking an artifact, acknowledging the way it is usually perceived, but also acknowledging the MANY other PERSPECTIVES that you could be VIEWING this thing from that would CHANGE your entire VIEW of it. Picture how different someone living in the United States felt about the Berlin Wall as opposed to someone living in East Germany. Now apply that to every artifact in a museum, and add in TONS of ALTERNATIVE perspectives that would allow people to UNDERSTAND their history more broadly, feel more CONNECTED to their history, ala Simone Weil they might RECEIVE the universe more openly rather than trying to project a homogenous worldview onto it…there is NO REASON to Susan Sontag why someone LEAVING a museum doesn’t have an ENTIRELY new perspective on the world of the PRESENT DAY. There is NO REASON WHY the experience someone’s paying for when they GO to a museum can’t  be about SHAKING OFF, the emotional DISTANCE between them and the events of the world…not adding ANOTHER layer of separation, where its about shaking people OUT of complicity with the oversimplified narrative, not just giving them MORE of the narrative…there’s no REASON why we HAVE to continue with this mythology that if you’re BORED when you go to a museum…you must just be a moron…wow…you know it’s not because of the insufferable self-gratification that’s going on all around you, gross…no it’s because you lack the intellectual sophistication to be AMUSED by this curiosity cabinet. Museums are missing out on a BIG opportunity there she thinks, but ANYWAY. To wrap up this episode today Sontag says at one point: “Compassion is an unstable emotion. It needs to be translated into ACTION…or it withers.”We CANNOT be satisfied with just REMEMBERING the suffering of other people…we can’t just sit around just THINKING about it…and things like museums, documentaries, the pictures and videos we look at on our phones…these are things that if we’re NOT CRITICAL about the way that we engage with them all the time…they allow us to fall DEEPER and DEEPER into this cult of nostalgia. Again, to Susan Sontag we are in a constant fight against this numbness, this apathy from our overexposure to images…but we’re ALSO in a constant fight against people who are trying to manipulate your emotions by PRESENTING images in a particular way–and I guess ONE THING’S FOR SURE…PASSIVELY…going through your life…TAKING this content in like it’s just some PLEASURABLE THING that you’re enjoying…UNDERSTAND the consequences of not being CRITICAL of your RELATIONSHIP to pictures and videos. We ALL know SOMEBODY who’s not putting in ANY effort in that area…and you can see the evidence of it in the simple, toxic way that they view other people. What level of effort are YOU putting in? Where do you exist along this spectrum of people…that are at the mercy of the PRIEST giving them their scripture?We need a new approach to our RELATIONSHIP with images. And just like if there was A PERSON in your life that was manipulating your emotions and for whatever reason you can’t get AWAY from this person maybe they’re a family member or a coworker. You’d BE a wise person to set up some clear BOUNDARIES with that person. You WOULDN’T just give them a free pass to DICTATE your emotional well being for the day. But pictures and videos are just ONE example of a technology we use that to Sontag is so normalized in our lives that we may be under thinking it. On the NEXT episode of the podcast, which will be out by the end of the month…we’ll be looking at ANOTHER example of what you could call a modern technology we’ve normalized. Susan Sontag is gonna offer a critique of the metaphor…and more specifically, how the metaphor IMPACTS the way that people understand and TALK about things like illness and disease.Because if the way we PASSIVELY consume images goes on to hurt people in ways that we never intended…the way that we PASSIVELY use metaphors goes on to hurt people that are suffering from things like cancer. On next episode we’re about to see what happens when one of the great American cultural critics of ALL TIME…gets us to QUESTION the specific WAYS that we use LANGUAGE DESCRIBE things that we don’t TRULY understand. Thank you for listening. I’ll talk to you next time.\"\n",

      "\"So the other day I was taking a walk around my neighborhood with my friend at like 4:30 in the morning. It was about 20 degrees Fahrenheit, well below freezing. Ground’s covered in frost and black ice, it’s pitch black outside… I’M sliding around everywhere trying to get a morning walk in like a COMPLETE genius here. And my friend who doesn’t read any philosophy turns to me as we’re doing this and he says, so this GUY you’re talking about…Giorgio Agamben…what’s HIS whole deal, you got any idea of what you’re gonna be saying yet? And right when he asks me im walking downhill and I hit a giant patch of black ice…and im just sliding downhill…and as I’m Tokyo drifting down the sidewalk of my neighborhood my head’s in another place and I say back to him well look one of the FIRST things you gotta know about him is that he’s not a big fan of human rights. That’s what I led with.And he looks at me and he’s like WHAT? Who is this guy Chairman Mao? What kind of monster is against the concept of human rights?And this is such a PURE response from anybody that’s been RAISED in western culture… that’s come to know human rights as one of the most SACRED things we have as part of our political process. It was MY response when I first heard about these ideas years ago. And it can be so mysterious at first: why would a philosopher like Giorgio Agamben be SO CRITICAL of something with such good intentions behind it? Something that really at bottom is just trying to protect the dignity and freedom of people going through dangerous times. Well if you’re somebody that’s been listening to every episode of this podcast for about the last year or so…you MAY remember, there was ANOTHER person we talked about recently that ALSO had a problem with human rights. I’m talking about Simone Weil. One of my personal FAVORITE philosophers, a woman Giorgio Agamben did a dissertation on when he was in school, a woman he has a tremendous amount of respect for, and someone it’s NOT CRAZY TO IMAGINE…may have INFLUENCED this AREA in his thinking. See Simone Weil thought that human rights… no matter how GOOD they may make people feel…they’re actually missing the point when it comes to what it is they’re trying to protect. One of the PROBLEMS she says is that human rights fundamentally are always trying to reduce humanity… down into the language of legal or commercial discourse. But that’s impossible she thought. Remember she had a GREAT example written down in one of her journals. She says to imagine a farmer that goes down to the farmer’s market. He’s gotta BUNCH of chickens. Look at all those chickens. And she says this FARMER…has a LEGAL RIGHT…to SELL his EGGS down at the farmers market for as much as he wants…he has the right to sell them for $20 a dozen if he wants to. He ALSO has the right to go out of business when no one wants to pay $20 for a dozen eggs. Now CONTRAST that she says with someone forcing a woman into prostitution. Now of course EVERYBODY knows this is wrong, it’s SO wrong there’s not a debate to be had. But Simone asks in her journal: is the REASON it’s wrong to FORCE a woman into prostitution because she has a legal RIGHT to NOT be a prostitute? Well no, that’s LUDICROUS she says. The reason it’s wrong is because you’re robbing some piece of what it is that makes her a person. You’re stealing her humanity in a way. Her POINT is: there’s a sense in which trying to DEFINE these sorts of things in LEGAL TERMS…ends up MISSING something that’s important about the whole process of protecting human dignity and freedom. Now Simone Weil ALSO says that rights are obviously not the most EFFECTIVE thing in the world…you want PROOF of this just look at any time an actual Hitler or Stalin comes around…any time a country decides to declare war and invade the neighborhoods of another country…those human rights go right out the window…they’re worth about the paper that they’re written on. Both Simone Weil and Giorgio Agamben ask in their own unique ways: could there BE a more effective strategy out there?This is the place in the conversation that Giorgio Agamben starts to develop his OWN critique of human rights. And fair warning: some of these points are no doubt going to move the needle. I’d just like to take a second to remind everyone that I am not a political ideologue, in fact far from it. I am but a humble podcaster. I like to entertain ideas that I don’t necessarily accept. That’s part of why people COME to this podcast to get exposed to things that make them see the world from a different angle. Just ask that you direct all scathing responses to giorgio.agamben@definitelynotstephenwest.com.  Anyway, BUILDING off of Simone Weil’s point he’d START by saying of COURSE people like Hitler are not gonna follow your little Geneva Convention. Yeah turns OUT… a guy with THAT kind of mustache is not exactly persuaded by you sending him a strongly worded letter expressing your disapproval of him. And not ONLY are human rights not even CLOSE to stopping people from being brutalized, just look at what’s going on in the world right now. The REVERENCE…the unquestionable RESPECT that people in the western world GIVE to human rights…you know, the kind of thing that makes people go WHAT? Who wouldn’t be for human rights…that respect…Agamben thinks it ACTUALLY makes human rights a concept… that creates new opportunities for imperialist regimes all around the world. How OFTEN… are human rights used as a smoke screen or a justification… to invade a country and HIDE the true intentions behind starting a war? I’ll try to give a balanced perspective here: how about the United States invading Iraq in 2003. There were a lot of reasons that were given for WHY we should be invading a country that didn’t attack us. Weapons of mass destruction was a reason given for sure. But another MAIN REASON that was GIVEN was that we are the LEADERSHIP of the world…and we have to spread DEMOCRACY and FREEDOM to that entire region. That we have a moral obligation to SAVE these people who are being tortured under the regime of Saddam Hussein. In other words: it was a humanitarian effort! Women are being treated horribly. Apostates are being murdered. We were TOLD in the United States on our TVs that they didn’t even have a SINGLE KFC in ALL of Baghdad. It had gone too far. We HAD to do something about it. You know it WASN’T because we wanted a foothold in the region, to have more political control over an area of the world that we wanted to have influence over . It wasn’t that we wanted to control the oil wells that if Saddam Hussein chose to manipulate them would have potentially catastrophic effects on the global economy. It wasn’t any of THAT. It was that we CARE too much about the people. Sarcasm aside, to Agamben, you can SEE how the LORE that surrounds human rights can sometimes be used as a smoke screen for the TRUE political motivations that underlie an aggressive move like that.Said I’d be balanced so let's take an example from somebody NOT the United States. MANY examples of the same thing going on from both Russia AND China. Take Russia invading Ukraine in 2022…or Crimea in 2014. Again, MANY reasons were given for that invasion. But one of the primary ones was that ethnic Russians, Russian speaking people who mostly IDENTIFY as Russian are VICTIMS of terrible human RIGHTS violations going on in Ukraine. WE gotta go SAVE em! We have a moral duty, as an incredibly caring and loving nation, to protect these innocent people who cannot protect themselves.  You know it’s NOT because Ukraine is the only neutral state between you and NATO and that NATO has been progressively trying to court Ukraine for years to join their alliance. It’s NOT because Ukraine has been increasingly modernizing in recent years, more capable of refining their own oil and that if they were to do that you wouldn’t be the only oil state in the region that could provide energy to Europe. It’s NOT because just geographically from a military strategy perspective taking Ukraine to the western mountain pass just puts you in a far better defensive position SHOULD a war ever break out between Russia and NATO. It’s NONE of those things. We JUST…CARE about the people, they have rights…and by golly do we just gotta respect the bajesus out of em. Once again sarcasm aside…Agamben would say look at how the TRUE political motivations can get obscured when you can dangle something like human rights in front of people that most of us think it would be insane for ANYONE to ever question. Human rights…have been the CENTRAL focus of western politics SINCE the end of the Cold War. Which raises ANOTHER problem with human rights to Giorgio Agamben…because they’re so monolithic in western political discussion…they actually end up PREVENTING us from talking about issues that are ALSO very important. Say income inequality, climate change, nuclear proliferation. All issues SOME would say are neglected, because MOST of our time is spent agonizing over which human rights should be written down on a piece of paper, just to be TRAMPLED on by the NEXT people in power. To Giorgio Agamben, the path forward is not that we need to just rethink or redesign human rights. HE thinks we’re far past that point…that BECAUSE of the way HISTORY has gone down we have SO MANY preconceived ideas about rights… that the BEST solution to HIM… is to find a political strategy that actually moves BEYOND human rights to something better. What sorts of preconceived ideas well how about that our rights include life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness…you now the assumption that our biological lives and free life choices… are things INTRINSICALLY tied up in what the government should be protecting. This connection permanently leaves room for what Agamben calls Biopolitics, where it’s seen as NORMAL for the government to control aspects of people’s bodies, how they USE their bodies, what sorts of lifestyles are acceptable for a citizen to have.

      "Thought:\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mThe provided snippets from the podcast transcripts give a detailed insight into Susan Sontag's perspective on images, suffering, and the role of museums, as well as her call for action rather than passive commemoration. To answer the question about who would like Susan Sontag's books, I need to synthesize the information from these snippets to understand the themes she explores and the type of reader who would be drawn to her work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thought: Based on the snippets, Susan Sontag's work appeals to individuals who are introspective and critical thinkers. Her books would attract those who are interested in the complexities of modern culture, the role of images in society, and the importance of active engagement with the world rather than passive consumption. I should now craft a response in the style of Stephen West, host of 'Philosophize This!', to convey this information conversationally.\n",
      "\n",
      "Final Answer: Hey there, thanks for reaching out with such a thoughtful question. You know, Susan Sontag was a master at peeling back the layers of our everyday experiences, revealing the profound and often overlooked complexities beneath. If you're the kind of person who finds themselves pausing to consider the deeper implications of a photograph or a visit to the museum, if you're someone who doesn't just want to remember history but to understand and act upon it, then Sontag's books might just resonate with you. She challenges us to be more than passive consumers of culture; she invites us to be active participants, to question, to critique, and to engage. So if you're someone who's not afraid to confront the uncomfortable or the controversial, to really think about the role of images and narratives in shaping our world, then diving into Sontag's work could be a truly transformative experience. Keep on philosophizing, and let those pages turn!\u001b[0m\n",
